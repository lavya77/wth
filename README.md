# My Python Learning Journey

This repository is my personal space where I practice and grow with Python.  
Itâ€™s not about perfect projects, but about documenting how I learn step by step.  

---

## ðŸŒ± What This Journey Includes
- Learning **Python basics** â€” variables, data types, loops, and functions.  
- Exploring **file handling** to read, write, and manage data.  
- Understanding **modules and packages** for organizing code.  
- Diving into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** with classes, objects, and `__init__`.  
- Building fun **mini-projects** like calculators and games.  
- Experimenting with **GUI development** using Tkinter.  
- Practicing and improving coding style with each step.

## ðŸš€ Goal
To strengthen my foundations in Python, move from simple scripts to structured programs,  
and prepare myself for real-world projects and backend development.

## âœ¨ Note
This repo is a learning diary. The code inside reflects different stages of my progress,  
mistakes I fixed, and concepts I practiced.  

Itâ€™s a journey â€” not the destination. ðŸŒŸ
